SGPA and CGPA Calculation:

SGPA
Step 1: List all the subjects taken in the semester.
Step 2: Note credits and grades obtained for each subject.
Step 3: Assign grade points:

S (80-100%): 10 grade points

A (70-79%): 9 grade points

B (60-69%): 8 grade points

C (50-59%): 7 grade points

D (40-49%): 6 grade points

E (Below 40%): 0 grade points
Step 4: Calculate weighted grade points (credits × grade points).
Step 5: Sum weighted grade points.
Step 6: Sum total credits.
Step 7: Calculate SGPA = (Sum of Weighted Grade Points) / (Sum of Credits).
Step 8: Round SGPA to 2 decimal places.

CGPA
Step 1: Gather SGPA values for each semester.
Step 2: Calculate total credits for all semesters.
Step 3: Calculate CGPA = {Sum(SGPA × Credits)} / (Sum of Credits).
